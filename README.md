# Where's Who?

A where's waldo-ish photo tagging game which has 2 levels where you have to look for 3 characters in each level. A timer runs while you search and the top ten people with the lowest times get to be on the leaderboard of the respective level. But do know that you will only be considered for the leaderboard on your first attempt for a certain level so that no one can exploit the lack of diversity of characters.
